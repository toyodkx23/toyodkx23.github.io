            <h2>What is Judo (柔道)?</h2>
            <p><b>Judo</b> is a Japanese martial art, combat sport, and Olympic sport that emphasizes throwing and grappling techniques to subdue an opponent. Founded by Jigoro Kano in 1882, its name translates to "gentle way," and it involves using an opponent's own force against them through skills like throws, pins, and submission holds like chokes and joint locks. </p>
